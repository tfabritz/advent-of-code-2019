# Advent of Code 2019

This repo consists of python notebooks to solve the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

I am (very) late to the party. While skimming through past years after doing 2023, I thought the intcode problems looked interesting.

To run, put the input for each puzzle into the corresponding day folder and name it `input.txt`
